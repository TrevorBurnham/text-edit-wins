<p>HTML Editing Zen</p>

<h2>What is Emmet?</h2>

<p>
  Formerly known as Zen Coding, <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">Emmet</a> is a
  Swiss Army knife for writing and editing HTML. Its signature feature is
  expanding CSS selectors into markup. For example, if you type "p" and then
  Tab, Emmet will give you a matching pair of paragraph tags. If you type
  "p.story", Emmet will give you those tags with the <code>class="story"</code>
  attribute.
</p>

<h2>Advanced markup abbreviations</h2>

<p>
  Emmet has a notion of addition and multiplication. Want to create an
  unordered list with three children? Just type "ul>li*3", then Tab. Try it!
  You can even Tab between the fields you create that way.
</p>

</p>

<h2>CSS abbreviations</h2>

<p>
  In addition to expanding CSS selectors into HTML, Emmet also gives you
  shorthands for properties in CSS. For example, rather than typing
  <code>border-radius: 8px</code>, you can just type <code>br8</code> and then
  hit Tab.

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>
  As if expanding abbreviations weren't enough, Emmet comes with a variety of
  commands (available in Sublime via the Command Palette) for editing HTML.
  Among the most useful:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wrap with Abbreviation:</strong> Want to put some text in a span
    with <code>class="icon"</code>? Just select it, use this command, and enter
    "span.icon".
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Remove Tag:</strong> Oops, don't need that span after all? Kill it
    in one keystroke.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Select Next/Previous Item:</strong> Select the next opening tag, or
    the next attribute within a tag.
  </li>
</ul>
